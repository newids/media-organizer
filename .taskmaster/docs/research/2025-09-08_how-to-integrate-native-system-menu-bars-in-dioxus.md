# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** How to integrate native system menu bars in Dioxus Desktop applications? What are the available APIs and configuration options for creating File, Edit, Help menus with native platform integration in Dioxus 0.6.x?

**Response:**

Dioxus Desktop (as of 0.6.x) does not yet provide a high-level, built-in API for native system menu bar integration. However, **native menu bars can be integrated by leveraging the underlying Wry and Tao libraries**—the same stack used by Tauri—via the `DesktopConfig` and low-level window APIs exposed by Dioxus Desktop[3][5]. This approach enables you to create native File, Edit, and Help menus with platform conventions and keyboard shortcuts, which is directly relevant to your Task 30 requirements.

## Current State of Native Menu Bar Integration in Dioxus 0.6.x

- **No first-class Dioxus API for menus yet:** As of 0.6.x, Dioxus Desktop does not abstract menu bar creation. The official documentation and guides recommend using the lower-level APIs from Wry and Tao for this purpose[3][5].
- **Upcoming features:** There are plans to add Dioxus-native abstractions for menubars, notifications, and global shortcuts in future releases, but these are not yet available[3][2].

## How to Integrate Native System Menus

### 1. Accessing the Window and Wry APIs

- Use the `DesktopConfig` struct when launching your Dioxus app to access the underlying window.
- The `use_window` hook can provide a handle to the native window, which can then be cast to Wry/Tao types for menu manipulation[5].

### 2. Creating Menus with Tao

Tao (used by Wry) provides cross-platform menu APIs. You can construct menus and submenus, assign keyboard shortcuts, and handle menu events.

**Example (Rust, simplified):**
```rust
use dioxus_desktop::{DesktopConfig, use_window};
use tao::menu::{MenuBar, MenuItem, MenuId, MenuType};

fn main() {
    let mut config = DesktopConfig::new();
    config.with_custom_setup(|window| {
        // Cast to Tao window and create menu bar
        let menu_bar = MenuBar::new();
        let file_menu = MenuBar::new();
        file_menu.add_item(MenuItem::new("Close", Some(MenuId::new(1))));
        menu_bar.add_submenu("File", true, file_menu);

        // Attach menu bar to window (platform-specific)
        window.set_menu(Some(menu_bar));
    });
    dioxus_desktop::launch_with_config(app, config);
}
```
- **Note:** The actual API may require more detailed setup and event handling, and you must ensure correct casting and safety when accessing the native window.

### 3. Handling Menu Events

- Listen for menu item activation events using the event loop provided by Tao.
- Map menu actions (e.g., "Close", "Open Settings") to Dioxus signals or message passing to trigger UI changes, such as opening the settings popup from the Edit menu.

## Configuration Options and Best Practices

- **Menu Structure:** Define menus and submenus using Tao's `MenuBar` and `MenuItem` types. For cross-platform conventions:
  - "File" menu: Open, Save, Close (Cmd+W/Ctrl+W)
  - "Edit" menu: Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy, Paste, Settings (open your settings popup)
  - "Help" menu: About, Documentation
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Assign platform-appropriate accelerators (e.g., Cmd+W for macOS, Ctrl+W for Windows) using Tao's accelerator API.
- **Settings Integration:** For Task 34, add a "Settings" item under "Edit" that triggers your Dioxus modal/popup for theme selection. Use Dioxus state/context to apply changes immediately.
- **Accessibility:** Native menus are accessible by default, but ensure your Dioxus popups and dialogs are keyboard-navigable and screen-reader friendly.

## Actionable Steps for Your Project

1. **Remove custom HTML/CSS menu components** as planned in Task 30.
2. **Configure the system menu bar** using Tao via the Dioxus Desktop `DesktopConfig` and `use_window` hook.
3. **Define File, Edit, and Help menus** with appropriate submenus and shortcuts.
4. **Wire menu actions to Dioxus events** to open modals (e.g., settings popup for theme selection).
5. **Test menu appearance and behavior** on both macOS and Windows for native look and feel, shortcut handling, and accessibility.
