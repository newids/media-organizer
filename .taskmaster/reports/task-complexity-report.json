			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Dioxus Project Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup into: 1) Create new Dioxus project with desktop template, 2) Configure Cargo.toml with all required dependencies, 3) Setup project directory structure, 4) Initialize main.rs with basic Dioxus app, 5) Configure cross-platform window settings and test compilation",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to multiple dependencies and cross-platform considerations, but follows standard project setup patterns. Clear deliverables make it suitable for subdivision."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core File System Service",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Create FileSystemService struct and basic error types, 2) Implement directory traversal with walkdir, 3) Add file operations (copy, move, delete, rename), 4) Implement permission checking and metadata extraction, 5) Add async support with tokio, 6) Create comprehensive error handling and cross-platform compatibility layer",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to cross-platform file operations, async programming, and comprehensive error handling. Multiple distinct functional areas that can be developed independently."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Create SQLite Cache Service",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Setup SQLite database schema and migrations, 2) Implement connection pooling and database initialization, 3) Create metadata caching methods, 4) Add thumbnail cache functionality, 5) Implement cache invalidation and cleanup mechanisms",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity involving database design, async operations, and cache management strategies. Each component has distinct responsibilities suitable for separate development."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Build VS Code-Style Layout Components",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Create main layout structure with Dioxus components, 2) Implement resizable panels with drag functionality, 3) Add CSS styling for VS Code appearance and theming, 4) Implement state persistence for panel configurations",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity due to custom UI components, drag interactions, and state management. UI components can be developed incrementally with clear visual feedback."

			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Virtual Scrolling File Tree",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Implement virtual scrolling calculation logic, 2) Create file tree item rendering with visible buffer, 3) Add folder expansion/collapse functionality, 4) Implement file selection state management, 5) Add keyboard navigation support, 6) Optimize performance for 10,000+ files with proper state hooks",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to virtual scrolling algorithms, performance optimization requirements, and complex state management. Multiple technical challenges that benefit from incremental development."

		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Create Multi-Format File Preview System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Implement image preview with multiple format support, 2) Add video thumbnail generation and metadata extraction, 3) Create audio waveform visualization, 4) Implement PDF preview functionality, 5) Add text/markdown preview with syntax highlighting, 6) Create background thumbnail generation system, 7) Implement EXIF and metadata display",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple file format support, external library integration, and background processing. Each file type represents a distinct technical challenge."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Build Search and Filter System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Implement real-time text search with fuzzy matching, 2) Create file type and metadata filtering system, 3) Add regex search support, 4) Implement search indexing for performance, 5) Create search history and saved searches functionality",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to search algorithms, performance optimization, and multiple filter types. Each search feature can be developed and tested independently."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement File Operations with Undo/Redo",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Implement Command pattern for operations, 2) Create batch file operations system, 3) Build undo/redo history stack, 4) Add progress tracking with cancellation, 5) Implement error recovery mechanisms, 6) Create confirmation dialogs and user feedback",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to Command pattern implementation, state management for undo/redo, and robust error handling. Multiple architectural components that require careful coordination."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Create Duplicate Detection System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Implement file hashing system with SHA-256, 2) Create background processing with progress reporting, 3) Build duplicate grouping and comparison logic, 4) Create user interface for managing duplicates",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity due to hashing algorithms, background processing, and UI for duplicate management. Clear separation between computation and presentation layers."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate State Management and Final Polish",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Implement centralized state management with Dioxus shared state, 2) Add keyboard shortcuts and hotkey system, 3) Create context menus and drag-and-drop functionality, 4) Implement settings persistence and theme support, 5) Final UI polish and end-to-end testing",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to integration of multiple systems, state synchronization, and comprehensive user interaction features. Integration task that requires coordination of all previous components."
