		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Establish VS Code-like Layout Foundation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the layout foundation into: (1) Dioxus component scaffolding for each major UI region, (2) CSS Grid implementation with VS Code proportions, (3) Codicons/SVG icon integration, (4) CSS custom properties and theming setup, (5) Figma UI kit mapping and visual alignment, (6) ARIA roles and keyboard navigation scaffolding.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multi-layered UI architecture, accessibility, theming, and strict visual fidelity, requiring expertise in modern frontend frameworks, CSS Grid, and accessibility standards. Each UI region and concern (structure, icons, theming, accessibility) is a distinct technical challenge, justifying a high complexity score and several subtasks."

		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Theme System with Auto-Detection",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) CSS custom properties setup for tokens, (2) System color scheme detection logic, (3) Theme switching logic and settings toggle, (4) Component consumption of theme variables, (5) Visual regression and manual tests for theme switching.",
			"reasoning": "Theme systems with auto-detection require robust CSS architecture, integration with system APIs, and UI state management. Ensuring all components consume theme variables and supporting manual overrides adds complexity, but the patterns are well-established in modern UI development."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Activity Bar and Sidebar Navigation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Activity Bar component with navigation icons, (2) Sidebar component with collapsible/adjustable width, (3) File explorer tree view implementation, (4) Keyboard shortcut handling, (5) ARIA labeling and accessibility, (6) Component and navigation tests.",
			"reasoning": "Building performant navigation with accessibility and keyboard support, plus a dynamic tree view, involves advanced UI patterns, state management, and accessibility compliance. Each feature is a substantial technical unit."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Create Tabbed Editor Groups and Panel",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: (1) Tabbed editor group component, (2) Split view support, (3) Drag-and-drop tab management, (4) Keyboard navigation and shortcuts, (5) Bottom panel with resizing and context menus, (6) Integration and visual regression tests.",
			"reasoning": "Tabbed interfaces with split views, drag-and-drop, and keyboard navigation are complex, requiring careful state management and UI event handling. The panel's resizing and context menus add further intricacy."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Command Palette and Keyboard Shortcuts",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Command registry and state management, (2) Fuzzy search implementation, (3) Keyboard shortcut mapping and event handling, (4) Shortcut cheat sheet UI, (5) Accessibility and discoverability tests.",
			"reasoning": "Command palettes and keyboard shortcuts require robust event handling, search algorithms, and accessibility. While common in modern editors, integrating all aspects cohesively is moderately complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Refactor State Management for Layout and Panels",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) LayoutManager and LayoutState struct design, (2) Dioxus signals/global state integration, (3) Settings Service for persistence, (4) Performance optimization for state updates, (5) Unit and integration tests for state transitions.",
			"reasoning": "Centralizing state across layout, panels, and theme involves architectural refactoring, persistence, and performance tuning. These are advanced but well-documented patterns in state management."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Design and Implement Preview Service Architecture",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) PreviewProvider trait definition, (2) Provider implementations for each file type, (3) Async preview generation and threading, (4) Thumbnail caching logic, (5) Fallback handling for unsupported types, (6) Integration with UI, (7) Performance and integration tests.",
			"reasoning": "Supporting multiple file types with async previews, caching, and extensibility demands advanced architectural design, concurrency, and integration. Each provider and system concern is a significant technical challenge."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Build Preview Panel UI with Controls and Metadata",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Preview Panel component scaffolding, (2) Zoom/pan/fit controls for images/docs, (3) Waveform/timeline integration for audio/video, (4) Metadata display (EXIF, dates), (5) Quick actions (rotate, copy path, open externally), (6) Lazy loading and progressive rendering.",
			"reasoning": "The Preview Panel must support diverse controls, metadata, and file types, requiring advanced UI logic, performance optimization, and accessibility. Each feature is a distinct technical unit."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate File System and Cache Services for Previews",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) File system service update for metadata extraction, (2) LRU cache implementation for thumbnails/previews, (3) Cache eviction policy design, (4) Progressive loading for large files, (5) Unit and integration tests for caching and memory usage.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating file system metadata and caching involves backend logic, memory management, and performance profiling. These are moderately complex but follow established patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Audit and Remove Redundant UI Components",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Component audit and identification of redundancies, (2) Replacement of labels with icons/tooltips, (3) Accessibility review and retention of essential elements, (4) Manual and user acceptance testing for clarity.",
			"reasoning": "Systematic UI audits and refactoring are less technically complex but require thorough review and accessibility validation. The process is straightforward but must be meticulous."
