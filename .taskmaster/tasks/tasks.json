Position the count display in the left section of the status bar, similar to VS Code's \"X files, Y folders\" format. 2) Remove Current Count Display: Identify and remove the existing file/folder count display from its current location (likely in the explorer panel or header area). Ensure no visual artifacts remain after removal. 3) Dynamic Count Updates: Implement real-time count updates that reflect changes when files/folders are added, removed, or filtered. Use efficient counting mechanisms that don't impact performance with large directory structures. 4) Formatting and Styling: Follow VS Code's text formatting conventions (e.g., \"1,234 files, 56 folders\" with proper number formatting and pluralization). Apply consistent styling with other status bar elements including font size, color, and spacing. 5) Context Awareness: Display counts relevant to the current view/selection - show total counts for the current directory or filtered results when search is active. Consider showing selection counts when multiple items are selected.",
