The system includes BatchOperation struct with transaction-like behavior, BatchProcessor for background processing using tokio channels, comprehensive progress tracking with real-time updates, cancellation support via tokio cancellation tokens, and robust error handling with rollback mechanisms. Key features implemented include atomic transactions with all-or-nothing execution, partial failure support with configurable behavior, retry mechanisms for failed commands, asynchronous background processing, real-time progress monitoring, and graceful cancellation with proper cleanup. Comprehensive test coverage has been added covering successful batch execution, rollback scenarios, async processing, progress tracking, partial failures, cancellation behavior, and retry configuration. The system is fully integrated with the existing Command pattern from Task 8.1 and maintains compatibility with existing file operations. All batch operation types are properly exported through the services module with tokio-util dependency added for cancellation token support. The batch operations system is now ready for production use in the MediaOrganizer application.\n</info added on 2025-08-13T16:14:16.237Z>",
